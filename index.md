# Spring 2025 Research

This project explores Sparse Convolutional Neural Networks for object detection in low-visibility environments.

## Goals
- Understand the basic architecture and uses of Neural Networks
- Learn how to code a basic neural network from scratch
- Understand the basic architecture and use of CNNs
- Improve detection accuracy in fog and low-light
